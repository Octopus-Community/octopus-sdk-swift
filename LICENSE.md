2.2 **Access to Source Code**

Licensor may provide the SDK source code for reference, debugging, and integration purposes. **This provision does not constitute an open-source license**; rather, it grants Licensee the right to view and compile the provided source code only as necessary for development of Authorized Applications in conjunction with the SaaS Service.

## 3. License Restrictions

3.1 **Permitted Use**

Licensee may use the SDK **only** to develop Authorized Applications that exclusively interact with the SaaS Service via the API. Any other use, including use with any third-party services or products, is prohibited unless expressly authorized in writing by Licensor.

3.2 **Modifications**

Licensee shall not modify, translate, adapt, arrange, or create derivative works of the SDK, in whole or in part, for any purpose other than (a) debug or integration efforts necessary for the Authorized Application to properly interface with the SaaS Service, and (b) as otherwise expressly permitted by Licensor in writing. **Under no circumstances** shall any modifications be used independently of the SaaS Service or for any other commercial or non-commercial use.

3.3 **Distribution**

Licensee may distribute the SDK (in compiled or other form) **only** as embedded or integrated in the Authorized Application, **solely** for the purpose of enabling end users to connect to and use the SaaS Service. Licensee is prohibited from redistributing the SDK as a standalone product or library.

3.4 **Prohibitions**

Licensee shall not:

- Sell, license, lease, rent, loan, resell, or otherwise distribute the SDK except as expressly set forth herein.

- Disassemble, decompile, or reverse engineer the SDK, or attempt to discover any source code therein (except to the extent that the SDK is provided in source form or as otherwise permitted under applicable law).

3.5 **No Competitive Use**

Licensee shall not use the SDK (in whole or in part) to develop or assist in the development of any product or service that competes with Licensor’s SaaS Service or any other product or service offered by Licensor. Additionally, Licensee shall not use the SDK to replicate or replace the core functionality of the SaaS Service.

4.2 **Feedback**

If Licensee provides any suggestions, feedback, or comments regarding the SDK or the SaaS Service (collectively, “**Feedback**”), Licensor shall be free to use, disclose, reproduce, license, or otherwise distribute and exploit the Feedback without any obligation or restriction, provided that such Feedback does not include Licensee’s Confidential Information.

## 5. Confidentiality

5.1 **Obligation**
